# Hermes multi-tenant fleet — deployment status & integration handoff

## What this is
A single Railway service running native Hermes (NousResearch/hermes-agent) that
hosts ONE Hermes profile per Avocado customer. Each profile = one Telegram bot,
pointed at that customer's own Avocado account via the Avocado MCP. Concierge
provisioning (by hand) is proven; self-serve (HTTP) is the next build.

## Infra (DONE — deployed and running)
- Fork: github.com/Wandersonjack/hermes-agent-avocado (main)
- Railway project: 6a99c622-2535-4283-88dc-aec51d734801, service "hermes-agent-avocado"
- Auto-deploy on push to main is ON.
- Persistence: Railway Volume mounted at /opt/data (= HERMES_HOME). Holds every
  customer's profile, memory, and state across restarts/redeploys.
- Service-level env: HERMES_HOME=/opt/data, AUTO_UPDATE=false. NO API keys at
  service level (see "Keys" below).
- Polling mode = outbound-only. No public domain, port, or webhook. No healthcheck.

## Key fixes made to get it deploying (all on main)
1. Synced fork v0.14.0 -> v0.16.0 (clean fast-forward). v0.14.0 used tini and
   LACKED the s6 per-profile supervision the multi-tenant model needs. 0.16.0
   ships s6-overlay /init (PID 1), docker/s6-rc.d/, cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles,
   and hermes_cli/service_manager.py.
2. Removed Docker `VOLUME ["/opt/data"]` from the Dockerfile — Railway rejects
   the VOLUME directive outright. Persistence is the Railway Volume instead.
3. Baked `CMD ["gateway","run"]` into the Dockerfile and removed any Railway
   custom start command. A Railway startCommand OVERRIDES the ENTRYPOINT, bypassing
   /init (s6) and failing with "executable `gateway` could not be found". The image
   must run its own ENTRYPOINT (/init -> main-wrapper.sh -> `hermes gateway run`).
4. provision-in-container.sh: chowns written config to hermes when run as root
   (railway ssh lands as root); OPENROUTER_API_KEY now optional (shared-key beta).
5. hermes_cli/container_boot.py: auto-start ALL registered profiles on container
   boot unless a `.paused` marker exists (upstream only revives state "running",
   which leaves every bot down after any redeploy — see Validation #4).
6. API-server per-end-user multiplexing (gateway/platforms/api_server.py +
   tools/mcp_tool.py): /v1/chat/completions accepts two optional headers from
   the Avocado app backend —
   - `x-avocado-user-id`: mixed into the derived session ID and used as the
     default long-term memory scope, so different end users never share
     sessions/memory through the one shared API profile.
   - `x-avocado-mcp-key`: overrides the mcp_servers.avocado Authorization
     for that run only, so generations bill the END USER's Avocado account.
     Implementation: MCP connections are pooled globally with auth baked in
     at connect time, so the override routes tool calls to a per-user pooled
     connection keyed by a fingerprint of the override headers (lazy
     connect, FAIL CLOSED — a bad key returns an error rather than falling
     back to the profile's default key and billing the wrong tenant).
   Requests without these headers behave exactly as upstream. Both headers
   require API_SERVER_KEY auth; key values are never logged.

## How it runs (architecture)
- /init (s6-overlay) is PID 1. It runs cont-init hooks, starts s6-rc services,
  then execs the container CMD (`gateway run`) as the "main program" via
  docker/main-wrapper.sh, which routes it to `hermes gateway run` and drops to
  the unprivileged `hermes` user.
- The default profile's `gateway run` just idles (no bot token = no Telegram loop,
  no reasoning calls, no keys needed).
- s6 `main-hermes` service is intentionally a no-op (sleep infinity); the dashboard
  s6 service binds 127.0.0.1 only (not exposed).
- Per-customer profiles live at /opt/data/profiles/<slug>/ with config.yaml + .env.
- `hermes -p <slug> gateway start` registers an s6-supervised gateway slot at
  runtime (service_manager detects s6). On every container boot,
  cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles (-> hermes_cli/container_boot.py) auto-restarts
  profiles whose last recorded state was "running". This is why bots survive redeploys.

## Per-customer provisioning (concierge — PROVEN, pilot-1 live)
Script: /opt/hermes/provision-in-container.sh (in the image). Refuses to run unless
$RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT is set (can never touch a local Hermes).

HOW TO GET A SHELL INSIDE THE RUNNING CONTAINER (this is the part the Railway docs
make confusing): use the Railway CLI's `railway ssh`, NOT a Railway Function (fresh
Bun container — no image, no script), NOT the Railway chat-agent sandbox, NOT your
laptop. `railway ssh` opens a session inside the live deployment where the script
exists and $RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT is set:

    railway ssh --project <PROJECT_ID> --service hermes-agent-avocado \
      --environment production \
      'SLUG=<slug> TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<...> TELEGRAM_USER_ID=<numeric> \
       AVOCADO_MCP_KEY=<avk_...> OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<sk-or-...capped> \
       sh /opt/hermes/provision-in-container.sh'

GOTCHA — `railway ssh` lands you as ROOT, not the hermes user. The script writes
config.yaml + .env, and (as of the chown patch) chowns them to hermes:hermes so the
supervised gateway (UID 10000) can read them. Without that chown you get
`PermissionError: /opt/data/profiles/<slug>/.env` at gateway start. If you ever see
that on an older script, fix with:
    railway ssh ... 'chown -R hermes:hermes /opt/data/profiles/<slug> && hermes -p <slug> gateway start'

What the script does: creates the profile, writes config.yaml (Avocado MCP scoped to
the customer's key, manual approvals, cron deny, safe toolset: image_gen/vision/tts/
web/memory/session_search/messaging/clarify/todo), writes .env (OpenRouter key + bot
token + TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS allowlist), chowns to hermes, and starts the gateway.
Idempotent. On success the gateway registers a dynamic s6 service slot at
/run/service/gateway-<slug>, so it's supervised and survives container restarts.

## Validation checklist (Part C)
1. Bot replies on Telegram from the customer's account. ✅ proven (pilot-1)
2. Image generates to the customer's Avocado account (their credits drop, not yours).
3. A different Telegram account is ignored (allowlist holds).
4. Survives a service restart/redeploy. ❌ FAILED 2026-06-12 on stock upstream, then
   FIXED by fork patch: a redeploy SIGTERMs every profile gateway → gateway_state.json
   records "stopped" → upstream's 02-reconcile-profiles only auto-starts state
   "running" → ALL customer bots stay down after EVERY redeploy. Fork patch in
   hermes_cli/container_boot.py: auto-start every registered profile unless a
   ``.paused`` marker file exists in the profile dir. Pause SOP:
   ``hermes -p <slug> gateway stop && touch /opt/data/profiles/<slug>/.paused``;
   unpause: remove the marker + ``gateway start``. RE-VERIFY after upstream syncs.
5. (Optional, paid model only) A $0.10 test-capped OpenRouter key, once exhausted,
   hard-stops the agent instead of continuing to spend. N/A under the shared-key beta.

## Keys / cost model (IMPORTANT for the Avocado integration)
- BETA MODEL (since 2026-06-12): ONE SHARED OpenRouter key for the whole fleet, set as
  the Railway service variable OPENROUTER_API_KEY (with a monthly credit limit set on
  the key itself in OpenRouter — that limit is the global blast-radius cap). Profiles
  inherit it via s6 with-contenv; the provisioner no longer requires OPENROUTER_API_KEY.
  Consequences: no per-customer spend ceiling (one heavy user can drain the shared
  budget; mitigations: agent.max_turns=40, cheap model, trusted beta users only) and
  no per-customer cost attribution at OpenRouter (recover later from per-profile
  state.db usage if needed).
- PAID/SELF-SERVE MODEL (deferred): per-customer OpenRouter key with a ~$10/mo hard
  cap, passed explicitly to the provisioner (still supported — a key passed via
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY is written to the profile .env and overrides the shared one).
- Reasoning model default: xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro (verified live OpenRouter slug,
  1M ctx, ~$0.44/$0.87 per M tok in/out). Override per customer with MODEL=.
- Image/video/audio generation goes through the customer's Avocado MCP key
  (https://www.avocadoai.co/api/mcp, Bearer auth) — scopes all generations +
  credits to THEIR Avocado account. No FAL/Anthropic/ElevenLabs keys in Hermes.
- Allowlist: TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS locks each bot to the customer's own Telegram ID.

## NEXT BUILD on the Avocado side — self-serve provisioning (Part D)
Turn the manual shell command into a customer-facing button:
1. Add provisioner/server.py to the fork as a supervised s6 service (not yet present),
   guarded by PROVISIONER_SECRET, exposed only on Railway's PRIVATE network.
2. Avocado backend endpoint POST /api/hermes/provision that:
   - mints an Avocado MCP key scoped to the customer's account,
   - creates a $10-capped OpenRouter key (OpenRouter provisioning API),
   - calls the Hermes sidecar over the private network with SLUG + the 4 secrets.
3. Supabase registry table: (customer_id, slug, telegram_user_id, bot_username,
   openrouter_key_id, avocado_mcp_key_id, status, created_at).
4. UI: "Connect your Telegram agent" — customer pastes their BotFather token +
   numeric Telegram ID; backend does the rest. Same engine as the shell command,
   driven over HTTP.

## Open items / gotchas
- provisioner/server.py does NOT exist yet — build it for Part D.
- Keep AUTO_UPDATE=false so a paid customer's bot never breaks from an unattended
  upstream pull. Re-sync to upstream deliberately, then re-test the 3 fork patches
  above (VOLUME removal, CMD, model default) since they diverge from upstream.
- Never expose the dashboard/API server publicly per customer — customers use
  Telegram only.

# Hermes multi-tenant fleet — deployment status & integration handoff

## What this is
A single Railway service running native Hermes (NousResearch/hermes-agent) that
hosts ONE Hermes profile per Avocado customer. Each profile = one Telegram bot,
pointed at that customer's own Avocado account via the Avocado MCP. Concierge
provisioning (by hand) is proven; self-serve (HTTP) is the next build.

## Infra (DONE — deployed and running)
- Fork: github.com/Wandersonjack/hermes-agent-avocado (main)
- Railway project: 6a99c622-2535-4283-88dc-aec51d734801, service "hermes-agent-avocado"
- Auto-deploy on push to main is ON.
- Persistence: Railway Volume mounted at /opt/data (= HERMES_HOME). Holds every
  customer's profile, memory, and state across restarts/redeploys.
- Service-level env: HERMES_HOME=/opt/data, AUTO_UPDATE=false. NO API keys at
  service level (see "Keys" below).
- Polling mode = outbound-only. No public domain, port, or webhook. No healthcheck.

## Key fixes made to get it deploying (all on main)
1. Synced fork v0.14.0 -> v0.16.0 (clean fast-forward). v0.14.0 used tini and
   LACKED the s6 per-profile supervision the multi-tenant model needs. 0.16.0
   ships s6-overlay /init (PID 1), docker/s6-rc.d/, cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles,
   and hermes_cli/service_manager.py.
2. Removed Docker `VOLUME ["/opt/data"]` from the Dockerfile — Railway rejects
   the VOLUME directive outright. Persistence is the Railway Volume instead.
3. Baked `CMD ["gateway","run"]` into the Dockerfile and removed any Railway
   custom start command. A Railway startCommand OVERRIDES the ENTRYPOINT, bypassing
   /init (s6) and failing with "executable `gateway` could not be found". The image
   must run its own ENTRYPOINT (/init -> main-wrapper.sh -> `hermes gateway run`).

## How it runs (architecture)
- /init (s6-overlay) is PID 1. It runs cont-init hooks, starts s6-rc services,
  then execs the container CMD (`gateway run`) as the "main program" via
  docker/main-wrapper.sh, which routes it to `hermes gateway run` and drops to
  the unprivileged `hermes` user.
- The default profile's `gateway run` just idles (no bot token = no Telegram loop,
  no reasoning calls, no keys needed).
- s6 `main-hermes` service is intentionally a no-op (sleep infinity); the dashboard
  s6 service binds 127.0.0.1 only (not exposed).
- Per-customer profiles live at /opt/data/profiles/<slug>/ with config.yaml + .env.
- `hermes -p <slug> gateway start` registers an s6-supervised gateway slot at
  runtime (service_manager detects s6). On every container boot,
  cont-init.d/02-reconcile-profiles (-> hermes_cli/container_boot.py) auto-restarts
  profiles whose last recorded state was "running". This is why bots survive redeploys.

## Per-customer provisioning (concierge — proven by hand)
Script: /opt/hermes/provision-in-container.sh (in the image). Refuses to run unless
$RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT is set (can never touch a local Hermes). Run in the Railway Shell:

    SLUG=<slug> TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<...> TELEGRAM_USER_ID=<numeric> \
    AVOCADO_MCP_KEY=<sk_avo_...> OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<sk-or-...capped> \
    sh /opt/hermes/provision-in-container.sh

It: creates the profile, writes config.yaml (Avocado MCP scoped to the customer's
key, manual approvals, cron deny, safe toolset: image_gen/vision/tts/web/memory/
session_search/messaging/clarify/todo), writes .env (OpenRouter key + bot token +
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS allowlist), and starts the supervised gateway. Idempotent.

## Validation checklist (Part C)
1. Bot replies on Telegram from the customer's account.
2. Image generates to the customer's Avocado account (their credits drop, not yours).
3. A different Telegram account is ignored (allowlist holds).
4. Survives a service restart/redeploy (volume + s6 reconcile brings the bot back).
5. (Optional) A $0.10 test-capped OpenRouter key, once exhausted, hard-stops the
   agent with an error instead of continuing to spend.

## Keys / cost model (IMPORTANT for the Avocado integration)
- OpenRouter key is PER CUSTOMER, written to that profile's .env. Hard spend cap is
  set on the key itself in OpenRouter ($10/mo). No fleet-wide OpenRouter key.
- Reasoning model default: xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro (verified live OpenRouter slug,
  1M ctx, ~$0.44/$0.87 per M tok in/out). Override per customer with MODEL=.
- Image/video/audio generation goes through the customer's Avocado MCP key
  (https://www.avocadoai.co/api/mcp, Bearer auth) — scopes all generations +
  credits to THEIR Avocado account. No FAL/Anthropic/ElevenLabs keys in Hermes.
- Allowlist: TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS locks each bot to the customer's own Telegram ID.

## NEXT BUILD on the Avocado side — self-serve provisioning (Part D)
Turn the manual shell command into a customer-facing button:
1. Add provisioner/server.py to the fork as a supervised s6 service (not yet present),
   guarded by PROVISIONER_SECRET, exposed only on Railway's PRIVATE network.
2. Avocado backend endpoint POST /api/hermes/provision that:
   - mints an Avocado MCP key scoped to the customer's account,
   - creates a $10-capped OpenRouter key (OpenRouter provisioning API),
   - calls the Hermes sidecar over the private network with SLUG + the 4 secrets.
3. Supabase registry table: (customer_id, slug, telegram_user_id, bot_username,
   openrouter_key_id, avocado_mcp_key_id, status, created_at).
4. UI: "Connect your Telegram agent" — customer pastes their BotFather token +
   numeric Telegram ID; backend does the rest. Same engine as the shell command,
   driven over HTTP.

## Open items / gotchas
- provisioner/server.py does NOT exist yet — build it for Part D.
- Keep AUTO_UPDATE=false so a paid customer's bot never breaks from an unattended
  upstream pull. Re-sync to upstream deliberately, then re-test the 3 fork patches
  above (VOLUME removal, CMD, model default) since they diverge from upstream.
- Never expose the dashboard/API server publicly per customer — customers use
  Telegram only.

## Repo files specific to this deploy
- Dockerfile          — patched: no VOLUME directive; CMD ["gateway","run"].
- railway.json        — DOCKERFILE builder; restart ON_FAILURE; NO startCommand.
- provision-in-container.sh — concierge per-customer provisioner (Railway-only guard).
- HANDOFF-DEPLOY.md    — original deploy runbook (STEP 0 sync, Parts A-D).
- HERMES-FLEET-HANDOFF.md — this file.
